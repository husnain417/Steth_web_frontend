These are perfectly suited for our hospital environment and much better quality than what's available locally at Liberty Market. The deep pockets are ideal for keeping my phone, prescription pad and small equipment. Even after multiple washes in our harsh water, the color stays perfect. Worth every rupee!",

The material is excellent for our hot climate - breathable even during summer duties. Only issue is they run slightly large compared to local brands. I'm normally a medium but should have ordered small. Otherwise perfect for long OPD shifts.",

These scrubs are brilliant - withstood a 36-hour shift during a major emergency situation last week. The stitching is strong and the pockets are spacious enough for essentials. Also dried quickly after washing which is important in Rawalpindi's unpredictable weather. Already ordered another set!",

The only reason for 4 stars is I wish they offered more traditional Pakistani colors like deep green. Otherwise, the quality and comfort are excellent for the price.",
